## Analyses

The main analysis notebook is `main_analyses.Rmd`. Running this notebook will generate Figures 2, 3, S1, S3, and S4. Running the notebook in full takes a couple of hours. 

`additional_figures.Rmd` generates figure panels for seasons, moon phases, and color, which appear in Figures 4 and S2.
