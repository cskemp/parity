## Analyses

The main analysis notebook is `main_analyses.Rmd`. Running this notebook will generate Figures 2, 3, S1, S3, and S4. Running the notebook in full takes a couple of hours. 

`additional_figures.Rmd` generates figure panels for seasons, moon phases, and color, which appear in Figures 4 and S2.

`generate_phylogenies.R` contains functions for building the phylogenies used in the phylogenetic regression analysis, and is used in `main_analyses.Rmd`. It is a lightly-edited version of `generate-phylogeny.R`, which is available [here]( https://zenodo.org/records/5576242 ) and released as part of Guzm√°n Naranjo and Becker (2022), [Statistical bias control in typology]( 
https://doi.org/10.1515/lingty-2021-0002 )
