# Murdock kinship data

The Murdock data were originally published in Murdock (1970), Kin term patterns and their distribution, Ethnology, 9(2). This paper was reprinted in World Cultures, 11(1) in 2000 and our data are based on the electronic data file that accompanied this reprint.

`rwpartitions.txt` is derived from that data file and was downloaded from a [zip file]( http://charleskemp.com/kinship/murdockdata.zip ) released to accompany Kemp and Regier (2012), Kinship categories across languages reflect general communicative principles.
