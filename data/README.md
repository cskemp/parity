## Data 

This folder includes data files for all domains except for color. Color data are based in the [`wcs`]( https://rdrr.io/github/jvosten/wcs/ )  package prepared by jvosten.

`ozspace_sizes.csv` is derived from the original data base of locational systems provided by Dorothea Hoffmann, Bill Palmer and Alice Gaby. This data base is not included in this repository.
